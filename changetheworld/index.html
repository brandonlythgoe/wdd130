                <p> Ryan has had his fair share of battles throughout his life. He has struggled with mental illness, trauma, and addiction. 
                    These experiences have helped him to become the person he is today. Instead of allowing these struggles to discourage him and weigh him down,
                    He has used them to learn, grow, and help others. His biggest strength is the empathy he has gained because of the trials he has faced.
                    This empathy, combined with his knowledge make him one of the most sought after counselors in the U.S. Ryan has a Degree in Social Work,
                    and a Ph.D in Pyschology. </p>
