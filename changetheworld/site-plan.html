      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Create a website for my brothers future rehab center. Provide the details of what the rehab center will do
        and use it as a template for what we want the actual website to be one day.
        My brother Ryan and I have the goal of making a real difference for those struggling with mental health issues and addictions.
        With His expertise in the medical field, and my knowledge in the tech industry we hope to help everyone increase their
        exposure and knowledge of their mental health and those who are struggling with addictions.

        of those who may be struggling around them.</p>  <!-- change this -->
