    <h2> Brandon Lythgoe </h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Brandon, I am student at BYU-Idaho, studying Data Science. I got married in April to my wife Emma. We love it here in rexburg, and love being outside with our new puppy Leo!</p>
    <br>
    <p> I chose to study Data science, because I am fascinated by learning how to solve problems through data. I also love to learn more about how computers work, and gain a lot of satisfication from learning new programming skills. </p>
    <br>
    <p> I have been a member of the church all of my life. I served a mission in Austin, Texas. I got home last summer, and still think about the lessons I learned and the people I met every day. My favorite scripture is 2 Timothy 1:7 "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."</p>
